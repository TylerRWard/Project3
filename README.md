## Summary
I started with reading in the test files and being able to print them to 
the screen. I then started with the 1d version and realised I needed a brute force. Then ended with the 2d version. I creaded boolean comparitors to help 
in the process. 


# Compilation
```bash
g++ -std=c++20 proj3.cpp -o proj3

./proj3 <input_file> <1|2|b>

```
